        <h2>Certifications</h2>
        <h2>Cisco</h2>
        <p>
            Back in high school, I took courses to become a Cisco Certified Network Associate
            (obtain my 
            <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCNA</a> 
            certification). I studied for almost 2 years taking all 3 sections of the final
            exam in Routing and Switching through Cisco. I am still interested in achieving this
            certification but choose to focus on other certifications at the current time.
            <br><br>
            I want to eventaully get certifications for Cisco's Security division and their Routing
            and Switching division. I believe that these certifications can help prove that I have
            the required knowledge to fit these roles.
        </p>
        <h2>CompTIA</h2>
        <p>
            Recently I have been studying for the CompTIA Security+ Certification. I have been taking
            a course by Mike Chapple through
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/prepare-for-the-comptia-security-plus-sy0-601-certification-exam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn Learning</a>. 
            The course goes into great detail for each topic coveredon the exam. I want to pass this 
            certification so I have a firm foundation inside the computersecurity ecosystem.
            <br><br>
            This certification is part of CompTIA's             
            <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/which-certification/stackable-certifications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stackable certification program</a>.
            Firstly, I want to finish the Security+ certification because it will be the most beneficial
            for me as I prepare to take more security oriented courses. Their stacking certification 
            system is unique as theyallow for people to take multiple different approaches to earning 
            the same title.
