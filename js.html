        <h1>Welcome to Koobster.net</h1>
        <h2>JavaScript Projects</h2>
        <p>
            I have recently finished a LinkedIn Learning Course overviewing JavaScript. I have written a few JavaScript statements linking a .js file to a HTML and CSS to show JavaScript objects in the Document Object Model (DOM). I started getting involved.
        </p>
        <h2>microSIEM Project</h2>
        <p>
            I have worked with a System Information Event Management (SIEM) system before. I like how these systems can hold large amounts of information and use the stored information to do functions, with the information. I want to make something like a SIEM in JavaScript. I want to use a pre-made log of events, allowing users to add more. I want the site to be able to sort by columns and select information within the columns. I want to graph data, and automatically generate false logs to simulate actual data flowing in to the system from Event logging systems throughout the network.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've worked with <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Malwarebytes</a> and <a href="https://logrhythm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LogRhythm</a> SIEM systems previously and enjoyed how they managed data.

        <h2>NASA APOD API Use</h2>
        <P>
            I started working with APIs too. I am interested in space and like how space looks. I saw that NASA has an <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API</a> showing a picuture of Space each day. They use an API to respond to requests. The API can be free to use but is rate-limited.
