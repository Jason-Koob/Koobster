        <h1>Welcome to Koobster.net</h1>
        <h2>About This Website</h2>
        <p>
            Koobster.net is my website that I will use to post progress towards my goals. 
            I am studying cyber security and computer networking. As I continue to learn
            I will over time, post updates and notes regarding my projects for languages and 
            technologies I interact with. This website itself is a project of mine and I intend to
            take care of it and maintain it with up-to-date information. The my GitHub page
            about this website is here:<br><br>
            <a href="https://github.com/Jason-Koob/Koobster" class="mail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/Jason-Koob/Koobster</a>
        </p>
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>
            I have some experience writing HTML. I am writing this website in HTML. I have
            written a few other websites, but those were only for a school related assignments.
            I plan to use different styles within the development of this website to further
            explore the depths of this HyperText Markup Language.
        </p>
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
            I have written very little JavaScript at this point. I am planning on learning JavaScript
            very soon and using my learnings on this site to improve it further. As I learn I will only 
            grow stronger.
        </p>
        <h2>Java</h2>
        <p>
            Java is possibly the first programming language I learned. I started learning to code in
            2021 and have steadily continued since then. Java is a language I enjoy writing as I think
            it is complex and still simple enough to understand.
        </p>
        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>
            I enjoy writing Python programs to help automate daily tasks and engage with coding.
            I have written a few Python programs, my favorites include a key-logging program, a timer
            program, and recently a command-line blackjack card game emulator.
        </p>
        <h2>Docker // Docker Compose</h2>
        <p>
            I have used Docker and Docker Compose for some home-lab projects. I recently started using
            Docker and Docker Compose to host services for friends. I hope to learn more about this very
            interesting service in the future.
