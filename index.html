        <h1>Welcome to Koobster.net</h1>
        <h2>About This Website.</h2>
        <p>
            Koobster.net is my website that I will use to post progress towards my goals. 
            I am studying cyber security and computer networking. I am in the process of 
            learning about technologies. I have learned some skills in my time studying,
            there is still more I need to know to become successful in my field.
        </p>
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>
            I have some experience writing HTML. I am writing this website in HTML. I have
            written a few other websites, but those were only for a school related assignments.
            I plan to use different styles within the development of this website to further
            explore the depths of this HyperText Markup Language.
        </p>
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>
            I have used CSS equally with HTML. I have been using both of these technologies for
            over a year now and still have lots left to learn about them. I want to incorporate
            new HTML and CSS features into this website to become familiar with them.
        </p>
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
            I have written very little JavaScript at this point. I am planning on learning JavaScript
            very soon and using my learnings on this site to improve it further. As I learn I will only 
            grow stronger.
        </p>
        <h2>Java</h2>
        <p>
            Java is possibly the first programming language I learned. I started learning to code in
            2021 and have steadily continued since then. Java is a language I enjoy writing as I think
            it is complex and still simple enough to understand.
        </p>
        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>
            I enjoy writing Python programs to help automate daily tasks and engage with coding.
            I have written a few Python programs, my favorites include a key-logging program, a timer
            program, and recently a command-line blackjack card game emulator.
        </p>
        <h2>Docker // Docker Compose</h2>
        <p>
            I have used Docker and Docker Compose for some home-lab projects. I recently started using
            Docker and Docker Compose to host services for friends. I hope to learn more about this very
            interesting service in the future.
