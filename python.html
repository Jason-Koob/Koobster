        <h1>Python  Projects</h1>
        <h2>My Python Experience</h2>
        <p>
            I've written the most in python out of any other langauge. I enjoy how simple python is to
            understand and how I can apply my python knowledge to common issues I have. At the moment
            python is my favorite language but i'm sure there are better alternatives to it like Rust
            or Go.
        </p>
        <h2>My Python Timer</h2>
        <p>
            I wrote a python script to remind me every second. It's basically a standard timer, but I 
            wanted to make it myself, without much external help. Firstly I needed to get the current 
            time and the desired time. I looked for the only major python library I would need for this 
            project. It is called
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">datetime</a>. 
            I used this library to get the current time and find the difference between desired time
            and the current time. I quickly realized I needed to get a format of time to convert the 
            current and the standard times to work together through the library. I found out how to do
            that with a minimal amount of research online. 
        </p>
        <p>
            * Not like doing research online is a bad thing.
            I just want to make something myself instead of going off a tutorial or else I wouldn't learn
            anything from it.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I wrote a function to ask the user for their desired time, asking them to use a year-day-month
            hour:minute:second format. I then combined their input with a format so the library could comprehend
            their answer as a time instead of a string of gobbledygook. Now all that was left was to make
            the actual timer. I used a while loop that re-acquired the current time every second thanks to the
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time</a>
            python library I also used. this library was really only used to wait an amount of time before
            re-acquiring the current time. Then the date time library would subtract the current time from 
            the current time and print the difference.
        </p>
        <h2>My Python Key-logger</h2>
        <p>
            I thought it would be a cool little project to write a key logger in python. After all, I'm
            studying cyber security and am interested in stuff like this. The first thing I did was
            find some libraries to use. I found was called
            <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pynput/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pynput</a>.
            This library lets me record the keyboard input regardless of if the python application is selected.
            In this project, I reused the 
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time python library</a>
             to log the time of an input.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this point, I had a way to record the inputs and get the time of the input, but I still
            needed to log the inputs to a file. This means that I started using the built-in 
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in open function</a>
            . This function allowed me to read, write, and overwrite data from files. This is the
            majority of the key-logger. I also recognized python colors and how cool they are. I also made a 
            fucntion in this project to print a menu even though I only call the function when the program loads?
        </p>
        <h2>My DnD Dungeon Generator</h2>
        <p>
            I play Dungeons and Dragons with friends on occasion. Sometimes I find myself lacking creatively
            to think of a dungeon design. So, I made some lists of options like room width/depth, hallway width/depth
            door types, enemy types and a few other options. I imported the
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">random python library</a>
             to choose an option from a select list and I added an option to choose one item from each list.
            This project didn't take me very long but it is still fun to use it from time to time and think of how the 
            dungeon would be to use in DnD.
        </p>
        <p>
            After making my own python program for this very common issue, I searched online and found out someone
            already made a
            <a href="https://donjon.bin.sh/5e/dungeon/index.cgi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Random Dungeon Generator</a>,
             which has more functionality than mine. This project
            was still fun to do because I got to use some new libraries and get some more experience working with python.
        </p>
        <h2>Blackjack Card Game Emulator</h2>
        <p>
            I expected this project to be finished very quickly because I thought I knew how to play the 'simple card game'
            known as blackjack. I thought all you had to do was get cards with a value of 17 and not 21 and hope you win.
            I was mostly correct in thinking that, except I forgot how to make things simple when writing code.
        </p>
        <p>
            I once again used the 
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">random python library</a>
            to randomly choose an item from a list. This time I needed to add the randomly choosen item to another list and assign
            a value to each item in this second list, then combine the values of this second list for a variety of values. I did
            this twice, once for the user and again for the dealer. I had to re-learn how to play blackjack. Upon doing so, I revised
            my code and copied over some of my functions. I then revised my code again in a now third attempt at making Blackjack
            in python. I told one of my friends about me making Blackjack and he joined in and helped me remember how to play the game.
            Thanks Jack.
        </p>
        <p>
            I finally got all of the issues sorted out and got a working budgetting system in place that reads and writes
            data from a file and allows the user to bet an amount of lesser or equal value from the value in the file. This function
            took some time but is well worth it. Now it feels like I'm actually losing something when I lose instead of just retrying.
            This project took me a few days and is well worth the effort put into it.
        </p>
