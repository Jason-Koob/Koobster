        <h1>Python  Projects</h1>
        <h2>My Python Experience</h2>
        <p>
            I've written the most in python out of any other langauge. I enjoy how simple python is to
            understand and how I can apply my python knowledge to common issues. At the moment
            python is my favorite language but i'm sure there are better alternatives to it like Rust
            or Go once I try them out.
        </p>
        <h2>My Python Timer</h2>
        <img class="img_project" src="TimerPNG.png">
        <p>
            I wrote a python script to remind me every second. It's practically a standard timer, but I 
            wanted to make it myself, without much external help. Firstly I needed to get the current 
            time and the desired time. I looked for the only major python library I would need for this 
            project. It is called
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">datetime</a>. 
            I used this library to get the current time and find the difference between desired time
            and the current time.I got the current time by using <code>datetime.datetime.now()</code>
            I quickly realized I needed to get a format of time to convert the current and the standard
            times to work together through the library. So I wrote a function to ask the user for their 
            desired time, asking them to use the <code>'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'</code> format. I then combined
            their input with a format so the library could comprehendtheir answer as a time instead of a 
            string of gobbledygook. Now all that was left was to make the actual timer. I found out how to 
            do that with a minimal amountof research online. I got the formatted current time using this:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code class="comment"># Get the current time</code><br>
            <code>current_time = datetime.datetime.now()</code><br>
            <code>date_format = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'</code><br>
            <code>formatted_current_time = current_time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')</code><br><br>
            <code class="comment"># Define and format the expected time</code><br>
            <code>formatted_expected_time = current_time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            I then compared the two formatted times by making a variable consisting of <code>formatted_current_time</code>
            and <code>formatted_expected_time</code> as strings. I used this string formatted variable to
            combine the string and the date format to each time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code class="comment"># Comparing current time with expected time</code><br>
            <code>current_time_string = str(formatted_current_time)<br>
                math_current_time = datetime.datetime.strptime(current_time_string, date_format)<br>
                math_expected_time = datetime.datetime.strptime(expected_time_string, date_format)<br><br>
                difference_time = math_expected_time - math_current_time<br>
                formatted_difference_time = difference_time</code><br><br>
            <code class="comment"># Tell user the difference</code><br>
            <code>print(difference_time)<br>
                time.sleep(1)</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            I used a while loop that re-acquired the current time every second thanks to the
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time</a>
            python library I also used. this library was really only used to wait an amount of time before
            re-acquiring the current time. Then the 
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">datetime</a>
            library would subtract the current time from the current time and print the difference:

        <h2>My Python Key-logger</h2>
        <img class="img_project" src="Key-loggerPNG.png">
        <p>
            I thought it would be a cool little project to write a key logger in python. After all, I'm
            studying cyber security and am interested in stuff like this. The first thing I did was
            find some libraries to use. The primary library I found was called
            <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pynput/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pynput</a>.
            This library lets me record the keyboard input regardless of if the python application is selected.
            In this project, I also reused the 
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time python library</a>
             to log the time of an input. For some reason I really liked to color my text, so I made a class
             containing a few colors like cyan, green, and yellow.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this point, I had a way to record the inputs and get the time of the input, but I still
            needed to log the inputs to a file. This means that I started using the 
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in open function</a>.
            This function allowed me to read, write, and overwrite data from files. This function provided the
            majority of the key logger:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code class="comment"># This records the keystrokes</code><br>
            <code>with pynput.keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:<br>
                listener.join()</code><br><br>

            <code class="comment"># This writes the recorded text to a file called records.txt</code><br>
            <code>with open('records.txt', 'a') as docWrite:<br>
                docWrite.write(localTime + key + '\n')</code>
        </p>
        <h2>My DnD Dungeon Generator</h2>
        <img class="img_project" src="DnDGenPNG.png">
        <p>
            I play Dungeons and Dragons with friends on occasion. Sometimes I find myself lacking creativity
            to think of a dungeon design. So, I made some lists of options like room width/depth, hallway width/depth
            door types, enemy types and a few other options. I imported the
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">random python library</a>
             to randomly choose an option from a selected list and I added an option to choose one item from each list.
            This project didn't take me very long but it is still fun to use it from time to time and think of how the 
            dungeon would be to use in DnD.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code class="comment"># Some of the options for my lists of possible items</code><br>
            <code>Trap = ["floor Spikes", "arrows From Wall", "mimic Chest", "falling Floor Tiles", "puzzle", "dart Door", "rats"]<br>
                Door = ["wooden", "stone", "iron", "fake Door", "painting Door"]<br>
                EnemyType = ["zombie", "skeleton", "spider", "rat", "elemental", "vampire", "draugr", "ghost"]</code><br><br>
            <code class="comment"># An example of using the random library</code><br>
            <code>respChoice = input()<br>
                if respChoice == "5":<br>
                print("The trap is: " + random.choice(Trap))</code><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            After making my own python program for this mundane issue, I searched online and found out someone
            already made a
            <a href="https://donjon.bin.sh/5e/dungeon/index.cgi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Random Dungeon Generator</a>,
             which has more functionality than mine. This project was still fun to do because I got 
             to use some new libraries and get some more experience working with python.
        </p>
        <h2>Blackjack Card Game Emulator</h2>
        <img class="img_project" src="BlackjackPNG.png">
        <p>
            I expected this project to be finished very quickly because I thought I knew how to play the 'simple card game'
            known as blackjack. I thought all you had to do was get cards with a value of 17 and not 21 and hope you win.
            I was mostly correct in thinking that, except I forgot how to make things simple when writing code. However,
            this game took me a few days to get right, and even then it still has its flaws.
        </p>
        <p>
            I once again used the 
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">random python library</a>
            to randomly choose an item from a list. This time I needed to save the randomly choosen item to another list and assign
            a value to each item in this second list, then combine the values of this second list for a variety of values as shown 
            below:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code class="comment"># Converting face cards into an integer value for comparing them to numbered cards</code><br>
            <code>    for i in uCards:<br>
                if i == 'J':<br>
                    uValue = int(uValue) + 10<br>
                elif i == 'K':<br>
                    uValue = int(uValue) + 10<br>
                elif i == 'Q':<br>
                    uValue = int(uValue) + 10<br>
                elif i == 'A':<br>
                    uValue = int(uValue) + 11<br>
                else:<br>
                    uValue = int(i) + uValue</code><br><br>
        
            <code class="comment"># Aces are special because they are worth 11 and 1 in different circumstances</code><br>
                <code>for i in uCards:<br>
                if uValue > 21 and i == 'A':<br>
                    uValue = int(uValue) - 10</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            I did this twice, once for the user and again for the dealer. I had to re-learn how to play blackjack. Upon doing so, I revised
            my code and copied over some of my functions. I then revised my code again in a now third attempt at making Blackjack
            in python. I told one of my friends about my Blackjack idea and he joined in and helped me remember how to play the game.
            Thanks Jack.
        </p>
        <p>
            I finally got all of the issues sorted out and got a working betting system in place that reads and writes
            data from a file and allows the user to bet an amount of lesser or equal value from the value in the file. This function
            took some time but is well worth it. Now it feels like I'm actually losing something when I lose instead of just retrying.
            This project took me a few days and is very much worth the effort put into it.
        </p>
        <h2>Console Dungeons and Dragons</h2>
        <img class="img_project" src="ConsoleDnD.png">
        <p>
            I like to play Dungeons and Dragons in my free time with friends. Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) allows for people to encounter difficult challenges and deal with them in creative ways. I play it with friends currently and have been playing it for a while now.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a challenge to myself to test my abilities to code in Python I decided to start an epic quest to create Dungeons and Dragons in Python. My program uses a few external sources like the 
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">random python module</a>
            to perfrom a roll of dice which is very common in DnD. I like using the
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in OS Module</a>
            to clear the screen of clutter. I am still in the process of writing and testing this task, but it has quite a ways to go before it is done.
            In the future, I want to add randomization to locations, NPC names, and challenges the player might face during their journey.
